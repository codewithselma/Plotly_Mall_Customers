# Plotly_Mall_Customers
The notebook includes data visualization charts using Plotly and two Clustering Algorithms to classify the mall customers based on some defined parameters.

**UNFORTUNATELY, GitHub doesn't support rendering Plotly figures, so make sure to download my notebook or visit my kaggle account @codewithselma/plotly-mall-customers to take a deeper look at it!**

Happy reading! :)
